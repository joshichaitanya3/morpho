# Finite Element types

This folder contains some examples using finite elements beyond linear Lagrange elements (CG1). These require the new optimization package, optimize4. To install, type: 

    morphopm install optimize4 

in a terminal.

## Examples

* electrostaticsCG2.morpho - Solve Laplace's equation on a square with dirichlet boundary conditions and using CG2 elements. Follows the original example in  ../electrostatics

* qtensorCG2.morpho - Solve the liquid crystal q tensor problem on a disk. Follows the original example in ../qtensor.
